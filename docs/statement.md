## Basic Info

This plugin has been developing since 2022 and is ArchiTed's little (maybe not so little now) fun project. It all started as a plan to help people who are not great at doing their rotations enjoy the game while not being a liability to their parties or other players.

Being Archi's little project, this is also used by him to learn new coding stuff so that it might break from time to time, but it's always fixed as soon as possible, and when that happens it's always back and better than before!

This plugin is not intended to be a bot or to farm stuff while you are not playing. It helps you but it doesn't replace human involvement. Please respect the purpose that it was made for.

Not limited to these addons, generally anything that interacts with targetting or skill usage.

## Personal thoughts

ArchiTed is not good at playing the MMORPGs like FF14. And ArchiTed loves the simulation strategy games more. So the Rotation Solver turns the FF14 into a strategy game. 

So ArchiTed enjoys developing Rotation Solver more than playing FF14.

And the point is: Please don't ask ArchiTed to do anything about fixing rotations or adding new features. 

Caaaaat was right, Rotation Solver is ArchiTed's plugin.
