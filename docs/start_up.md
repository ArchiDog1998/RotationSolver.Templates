## The way to install

<!--Pictures are needed!-->

```
- Click on the + button and make sure the check mark beside the new field is set afterward.
- **Click on the Save icon in the bottom right.**

Following these steps, you should be able to see all contained plugins in the Available Plugins tab in the Dalamud Plugin Installer.
No plugins will be installed, you have just made them available. You can now select which of these plugins you want to install.

That's all.
