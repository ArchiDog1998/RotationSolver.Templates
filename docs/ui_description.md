# UI Description

The whole UI stuff was created based on the Repo [XIVConfigUI](https://github.com/ArchiDog1998/XIVConfigUI). If you love this UI style, you can try to use it in your project!

## Switch Panel

 You can click the panel on the left side, to switch between windows.

## Config Types

Almost all configs can be changed by the macro. So you can add any settings to your macro or qolbar to make it easy to change during combat, if it is necessary.
