# Rotation Solver

Hi, thank you for using Rotation Solver!

Description

> Analyses combat information in every frame and finds the best action.
>
> This means almost all the information available in one frame in combat, including the status of all players in the party, the status of any hostile targets, skill cooldowns, the MP and HP of characters, the location of characters, casting status of the hostile target, combo, combat duration, player level, etc.
>
> Then, it will highlight the best action on the hot bar, or help you to click on it.
>
> It is designed for GENERAL COMBAT, not for savage or ultimate. Use it carefully.

## Features

- Customize your rotation further then what the rotation developer created by using the Forced Conditions or Disabled conditions that you can set up yourself.
- Load different rotations made by different people, who knows, maybe one is better for something, another one is better for something else.
- Set up UI elements in different ways according to what you want to have or your screen or for what purpose you intend to use Rotation solver.
- Have different ability types being used automatically or manually, maybe you want to heal for yourself or maybe you want to do your rotation and not to be bothered by defensive skill usage for example, you can do that!
- Try and learn your rotation even manually by having skills being lit up on the skill bar.
- Test out new classes that you never played at a pretty good level, maybe you like how they feel or to get a party finder spot easier. 
- Set up abilities being used according to a timeline or according to different triggers like casts or vfx used in combat for more optimization if you want.
