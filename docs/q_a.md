# Q&A

## Why don't my rotations work properly?

- Check if the skills are enabled.
- Check if you have any conditions set up on any of the skills.

## Why isn't it fully open-source?

Well, Archi loves sharing everything he learned with everyone. However, there are 2 main reasons.

- Some players argue that removing some features I love, makes me bad about developing this plugin.
- I want to add some supporter-only features.
- Some developers just copied my unpublished code, or copied the entire repository but changed the author to himself.

## How can I get the Supporter-only features?

- Join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/9D4E8eZW5g).
- Connect your ko-fi account to your discord
- Support Archi on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/archited).
- Wait for the ko-fi bot to add the role of `Supporter` to you.
- Use the command `/supporter hash` to add your `Hash` in the game.
- Waiting for about 10 mins for the Github update...
- Reload the Rotation Solver plugin.
